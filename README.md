# LifeSafe v1.15a-Light

This is a compatibility fix so Firebase Anonymous Auth reliably shows on GitHub Pages / iPhone Safari.

## What you should see
Go to Uploads tab:
- "Firebase auth: initializing…"
- then "Signed in (anonymous). Device ID: XXXXXXXX…"

If you still don’t see it:
- You likely uploaded into a subfolder (must be repo root), or browser cache.
