# LifeSafe v1.04 (Static, zero-build)

Adds **in‑memory save**:
- Clicking **Save** creates a record in a temporary array
- The record appears as a **card** in the Home list
- No persistence yet (refresh clears) — that’s for V1.05 (LocalStorage)
- Slide-up modal, dim blur overlay, sticky Save button remain

## Upload
1) Open your GitHub repo
2) Upload these files to the root:

   - app.js
   - favicon.svg
   - README.md
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `(root)`

Then open your site and try **+ Add Record → Save**.
