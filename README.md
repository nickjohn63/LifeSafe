# LifeSafe v1.14-Light

**Locked visual design:** light grey background, pastel blue header, rounded white cards, system font.

## New in v1.14
- Added **Uploads** tab (preview) â€” pick files, we store **file metadata** (name, type, size, modified) in **LocalStorage**.
- Each file shows a **Not synced** badge (cloud sync not yet enabled).
- All previous tabs and features intact (records, edit/delete with warning popup, Google Calendar 10:00).

## Deploy
Upload all files to your repo root and refresh GitHub Pages.
